Aindrila Mukhopadhyay, a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 
says the amount of troubleshooting the researchers did to create each functional module is impressive. 
“A lot of people are charmed by the idea of creating complex genetic circuits. 


Researchers have made great progress in recent years in the design and creation of biological circuits -- systems that, 
like electronic circuits, can take a number of different inputs and deliver a particular kind of output. 

But while individual components of such biological circuits can have precise and predictable responses, 
those outcomes become less predictable as more such elements are combined. 

Scientists have now come up with a way of greatly reducing that unpredictability, 
introducing a device that could ultimately allow such circuits to behave nearly 
as predictably as their electronic counterparts.
